by Qingyu Zhang
## Introduction
Course project for CMSC6950 Spring 2021.<br><br>
**sbpy** is a community effort to build a Python package for small-body planetary astronomy in the form of an Astropy affiliated package.<br><br>
sbpy is available and being maintained as a github repository at github.com/NASA-PlanetaryScience/sbpy; documentation is available on sbpy.readthedocs.io

## Setup
1. Install [mini-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
2. Create virtual environment: <br>
conda create -n python=3.6 <br>
**note**: python 3.6 is the compatible python version to work with sbpy.
3. Dependencies: <br>
    - conda install sbpy
    - conda install -c conda-forge openorb
## Computational Task
1. Using the Haser-model to calculate the column density of CO2.
2. extract the orbit data of a planet, compute and plot its orbit and position at a designated time.
